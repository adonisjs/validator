## Introduction
This is the repo for the legacy Validator mainly used by AdonisJS v5. We ported it to AdonisJS 6 in order to allow users to easily migrate to AdonisJS 6. 

The new validator is now [Vine.js](vinejs.dev) and we recommend migrating to it and using it for new projects.

## Official Documentation
The documentation for the legacy validator is available on the [AdonisJS website](https://v6-migration.adonisjs.com/guides/validator-introduction)
